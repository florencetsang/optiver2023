## Get started with the environment - know how to run the notebook & make submissions on Kaggle. 
Be able to run these 2 notebooks and make the submissions

## Local notebook environment setup
Although we can build models end-to-end already on Kaggle's jupyter notebook environment, it would time out after some time. So it would be better to run the jupyter notebooks locally. It is also better for our collaboration via Git. I can walk you through the rest of the set up via a zoom call, but it'd help if you all install these in the meantime if haven't already. 
- install git (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- install jupyter notebook (https://noteable.io/jupyter-notebook/install-jupyter-notebook/)

## Steps to use CS GPU Farm
To train models faster, we might need to use CS GPU Farm.
